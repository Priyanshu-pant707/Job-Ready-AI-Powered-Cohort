# List Virtualization :
- it is a performance technique where:
  - only the items currently visible on the screen are rendered in the DOM,instead of rendering the entire list.


- Even if your list has 10,000 items , the DOM may only contain 20-30 at any moment .




# NEED ?
- the core problem is to render large lists normally .
- Problems :
    - huge DOM size.
    - Slow initail render
    - Laggy scrolling
    - High memory usage
    - Reconciliation becomes expensive
- Browsers struggle with thousands of Dom Nodes .


# How list virtualization works ?
1. Calculate viewport height.
2. Determine which items are visible
3. Render only those items
4. Add top and bottom paddin to simulate full height
5. On scroll -> update visible range


#### Summary :
- List virtualizatio is a performance optimization technique where only the visible portion of a large list is rendered in the DOM. As the user scrolls,OFF-screen items are recycled and replaced with new ones. This reduces DOM size,improves rendering performance and ensures smooth scrolling in data-heavy applications.
