# Suspense :

- Suspense is a react component that allows you to pause rendering until some asynchronous operation (like lazy laoding) is completed, and show a fallback UI in the meantime .


- suspense itself does not fetch data - it handles waiting.


# Why suspense is needed ?

- Without Suspense :
   -  blank screen
   - UI flickering
   - Poor UX
   - No loading indication

- With Suspense  :
 - Controlled Loading state
 - Better UX
 - Smooth transitions
 - Predictable rendering


- basic syntax :
```js
<Suspense fallback={<Loader />}>
  <LazyComponent />
</Suspense>
```


 ### key Parts :
   - Suspense Boundary  ->  area that can pause
   - Fallback -> ui shown while waiing
   - Lazy Component -> async-loaded component.



## How it works ?

1. React tries to render a component 
2.  Component throws promise
3. React pauses rendering
4. Fallback ui is rendered
5. Promises resolves
6. React re-renders actual component

- this is why suspense works perfectly with React.lazy




# Fallback :
- fallback is the ui shown while suspense is waiting


- Examples of fallback 
    -  spinner 
    - skeleton loader
    - shimmer UI
    - placeholder text





# summary 

- suspense : 
    - suspense lets react pause rendering until async dependencies are ready.


-  Fallback  : 
    - fallback provides a controlled loading ui while content is loading .
