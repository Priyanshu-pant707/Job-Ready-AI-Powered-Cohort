# Code Splitting

- code splitting is a performance optimization technique whereh your javascript bundle is split into multiple smaller chunks instead of one large file.



- only required code is loaded when it is needed.


## Without Code Splitting
 -  loads everything at once.
 - slow intial load
 - Bd for mobile & slow networks.


## With code Splitting
  - problem it solves :
     - slow page load
     - high time-to-interactive
     - unneccessary js execution
     - poor core web vitals
 - Benifits :
   - faster initial load
   - better UX
   - Smaller JS chunks
   - Better caching



# How code splitting works ?
- bundlers like Webpack/vite analyze import() statements
- Each dynamic import becomes a separate chunk
- Browser loads chunk only when required




# Types of Code Splitting 

***A. Route-based code splitting***
- loads code only when a route is visited

```js

const Dashboard = React.lazy(() => import("./Dashboard"));

```
```
<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
  <Dashboard />
</Suspense>

```


- best for multipage SPAs
- admin dashboard
- SaaS apps




***B. Component-Based Code Spliting***
- Split heavy components like :
   - charts
   - maps
   - editors
   - modals

```js
const Chart = lazy(() => import("./Chart"));

```

- load chart only when user clicks "View Analytics".


***C. Conditional Code Splitting***
- load code based on conditions


```js
if (isAdmin) {
  import("./AdminPanel");
}
```
- used when :
  - role based UI
  - Feature flags


***D. Vendor  Code Splitting***

- split third-party libraries separately.

```js
node_modules/react
node_modules/lodash
```
- benifits :
  - chache longer
  - rarely changes
  




***Dynamic imports***
- pure javascript
```js
button.addEventListener("click", async () => {
  const module = await import("./math.js");
  module.add(5, 3);
});
```







``` 
code splitting improves performance by dividing large js bundles into smaller chunks and loading them on demand using dynamic imports , reduing initial load time and improving use experience.```
