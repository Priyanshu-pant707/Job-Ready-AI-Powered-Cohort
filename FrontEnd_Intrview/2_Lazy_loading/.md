# Lazy Loading :
- it is a performance optimization technique where resources are loaded only when they are needed , instead of loading everything at the initial page load.


## Resources can be :
 -  javascript components.
 - routes
 - images
 - videos
 - Data (Api calls)
 - Fonts



## Why Lazy loading is Needed :
-  problems without lazy loading :
     - slow initail page load.
     - large js bundle
     - high memory usage
     - Poor core web vitals.
- Benefits :
  - faster  first render
  - Reduced bandwidth usage
  - Better US on slow networks
  - Improved performance scores




## Lazy loading VS Code splitting :

- Lazy loading  :
    - load on demand
    - happens at runtime
    - uses split chunks

- Code splitting:
   - split bundle
   - happens at build time
   - enable lazy loading



# Types Of Lazy Loading :

1. Lazy loading component
   - components loads only when rendered

2. Route-Based lazy laoding
  - used in SPAs with React Router

3. Conditional lazy loading 
  -  used for :
      -  role based access
      - feature flags


4. Lazy Loading Images 
  - Native Browser Lazy Loading
  - browser loads images only when near viewport

5. Lazy Loading Data (Api calls)
```js
useEffect(() => {
  if (isVisible) {
    fetch("/api/data");
  }
}, [isVisible]);
```
- loads data only when component is visible.



## RULEs:

- default export required
- works only for components
- must be wrapped in ***<Suspense>***



### Note :
- Lazy loading improves performance by deferring the loading of non-critical resources until they are required , reducing intial load time and improving user experience.
