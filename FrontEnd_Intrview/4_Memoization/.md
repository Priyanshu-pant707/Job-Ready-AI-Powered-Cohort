# Memoization :


- caching the reult of a  function or computation so it doesn't run again unless its inputs change.


## Goal :

- Improve performance.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Reduce expensive calculations/API calls.




## WHY ?
- web apps have :
  1. Frequent re-renders
  2. Expensive computations (filter ,sorting ,charts)
  3. Repeated API-derived data
  4. Large component tree
- Without memoization :
1. slower ui
2. Wasted CPU cycle
3. Laggy UX



```
usememo() prevents expensive calculations on every render

```

- memoization has memory cost- don't overuse it.

***"We use useMemo for values, useCallback for functions, and React.memo for components."***




### Backend Memoization :

- simple in-memory cache
- Api response caching


## Memoization in Data fetching :

- (React query/SWR) ->  these library use memoization internally
- Cached by key
- Auto re-fetch only when needed


***React query handles caching,memoization, and background syncing.***




- summary:
  - Memoization is used to cache results of expensive computations or functions to avoid unnecessary re-renders and recalculations. In react, we use useMemo, useCallback, and React.memo to optimize performance, espacially in large components tress or data-heavy applications.
